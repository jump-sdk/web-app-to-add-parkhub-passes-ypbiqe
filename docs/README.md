# ParkHub Passes Creation Web Application Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for the ParkHub Passes Creation Web Application, a frontend-only solution that enables Jump administrators to create and manage parking passes in the ParkHub system.

## Project Overview

The ParkHub Passes Creation Web Application is a lightweight, frontend-only solution that directly interfaces with ParkHub APIs. It allows Jump administrators to view game events, manage existing passes, and create new parking passes that will be recognized by ParkHub scanners at stadium entrances.

This application bridges the gap between Jump's ticketing system and ParkHub's validation system, enabling legitimate parking validation by creating valid passes in the ParkHub system that can be properly scanned and validated at stadium entrances.
