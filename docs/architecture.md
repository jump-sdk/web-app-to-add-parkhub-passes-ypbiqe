# ParkHub Passes Creation Web Application Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture for the ParkHub Passes Creation Web Application, a frontend-only solution that enables Jump administrators to create and manage parking passes in the ParkHub system.

## 1. System Overview

The ParkHub Passes Creation Web Application follows a client-side architecture pattern with direct API integration to the ParkHub system. This approach was selected based on the requirement for a frontend-only implementation without backend development.

### 1.1 Architectural Style

- **Single-Page Application (SPA)**: The application is built as a React-based SPA that provides a seamless user experience without page reloads.
- **RESTful API Integration**: Direct communication with ParkHub API endpoints using standard REST principles.
- **Frontend-Only Implementation**: No backend services or server-side processing required.

### 1.2 Key Architectural Principles

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular UI components with clear responsibilities
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Predictable state management using React Context API
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, state management, and API communication
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive UI that works across different screen sizes
- **Security-First Approach**: Secure handling of API keys and data validation

### 1.3 System Boundaries

- **Client Boundary**: Browser environment where the application runs
- **External Boundary**: ParkHub API interface
- **No Persistent Storage**: No backend database or server-side storage
- **No Server-Side Processing**: All logic runs in the client browser

## 2. Component Architecture

The application is structured using a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns.

### 2.2 Core Components

| Component | Responsibility | Dependencies |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Router | Application routing and layout structure | React Router, Layout |
| ApiKeyProvider | API key management and authentication | ApiKeyStorage, ApiClient |
| NotificationProvider | Application-wide notifications | None |
| EventsPage | Display and manage events | EventsApi, EventsList |
| PassesPage | Display and manage passes for an event | PassesApi, PassesList |
| PassCreationPage | Create new passes for an event | PassesApi, PassCreationForm |
| ResultsPage | Display pass creation results | None |

### 2.3 Component Design Patterns

- **Container/Presentational Pattern**: Separation of data fetching and presentation
- **Compound Components**: Related components that work together (e.g., Form and FormField)
- **Render Props**: Components that take functions as props for flexible rendering
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable stateful logic (e.g., useApiKey, useEvents, usePasses)

## 3. State Management

The application uses React's Context API for global state management, with local component state for UI-specific concerns.

### 3.1 State Management Approach

| State Category | Management Approach | Justification |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| API Data | React Query + Context | Efficient caching and synchronization of server data |
| UI State | Local Component State | Keeps UI-specific state encapsulated within components |
| Form State | React Hook Form | Specialized library for efficient form state management |
| Authentication | ApiKeyContext | Global access to authentication state |
| Notifications | NotificationContext | Global access to notification system |

### 3.2 Context Providers

- **ApiKeyContext**: Manages API key state, storage, and validation
- **NotificationContext**: Manages application-wide notifications and alerts

### 3.3 State Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User actions trigger state changes or API requests
2. **API Communication**: API client handles requests to ParkHub endpoints
3. **State Updates**: Application state is updated based on API responses
4. **UI Updates**: Components re-render based on state changes

This unidirectional data flow ensures predictable state management and UI updates.

## 4. API Integration

The application integrates directly with the ParkHub API to retrieve events, manage passes, and create new passes. For detailed API documentation, see [API Integration](api-integration.md).

### 4.1 API Client Architecture

```
API Client Layer
├── ApiClient (Base Client)
│   ├── Request Methods (get, post, put, delete)
│   ├── Authentication Handling
│   ├── Error Handling
│   └── Retry Logic
├── Service-Specific Clients
│   ├── EventsApi
│   └── PassesApi
└── API Hooks
    ├── useEvents
    ├── usePasses
    └── useApiKey
```

### 4.2 API Authentication

The application uses API key authentication for all ParkHub API requests:

- **Storage**: API key is stored securely in browser localStorage with encryption
- **Transmission**: API key is included in the Authorization header of all requests
- **Management**: UI provides a way to update the API key if needed
- **Validation**: API key format is validated before storage and use

### 4.3 Error Handling

The API client implements comprehensive error handling:

- **Network Errors**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Authentication Errors**: Prompt for API key update
- **Validation Errors**: Map to form fields with clear error messages
- **Server Errors**: Display appropriate messages with retry options

### 4.4 API Services

| Service | Purpose | Key Methods |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| EventsApi | Retrieve game events | getEvents() |
| PassesApi | Manage parking passes | getPassesForEvent(), createPass(), createMultiplePasses() |

## 5. Routing

The application uses React Router for client-side routing between different views.

### 5.1 Route Structure

| Route | Component | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| / | Dashboard | Application dashboard with overview |
| /events | EventsPage | List of ParkHub events |
| /passes | PassesPage | List of passes for a selected event |
| /passes/create | PassCreationPage | Create new passes for an event |
| /results | ResultsPage | Display pass creation results |
| * | NotFound | 404 page for unknown routes |

### 5.2 Route Protection

All routes require a valid API key to function properly. The application checks for API key availability and prompts the user to enter a valid key if none is found or if the current key is invalid.

### 5.3 Navigation Flow

```
Dashboard → Events View
           → Passes View
           → Pass Creation View

Events View → Select Event → Passes View
            → Create Passes for Event → Pass Creation View

Passes View → Create Passes for Event → Pass Creation View

Pass Creation View → Submit → Creation Results

Creation Results → Create More → Pass Creation View
                  → View All Passes → Passes View
```

## 6. Security Architecture

The application implements security controls appropriate for a frontend-only administrative tool.

### 6.1 API Key Protection
